PB162 automated evaluation script
================================= 

Automatically executes the three evaluation phases 
 * tests
 * extras
 * sources

After each phase, user enters the number of points, otherwise the default is used.
The results are placed in text files named "Surname_Firstname_UCO" in a specified folder.

The program expects the JAR files to be named with the standard IS scheme: "UCO_Surname_Firstname.*\.jar".
